# BadCertFinder

This uses [Menkyo](https://github.com/Yasumoto/Menkyo) to find certificates
that are either going to expire within one month, or are issued by a CA
that is about to be
[distrusted by the major vendors](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html).
